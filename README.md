#### Summary:  
This project analyzes a Kaggle dataset to investigate factors influencing student academic performance, such as department, family background, and lifestyle choices. The main goal was to build a Streamlit app for interactive data visualization and the focus was on creating engaging visualizations to allow users to explore relationships within the data. The analysis was conducted prior to my learning about Python's correlation functions, therefore, the dataset was not ideal due to its low correlation between columns and lack of cleanliness. midterm.md is the original markdown version of my midterm project.
